# DeckShuffler
Generates and shuffles a deck of cards using Python.
Arrays of strings were used.

Stores suites (Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts and Spades)
Stores card numbers (Ace, Two ... Queen, King)
It combines the strings and stores them in a deck (Ace of Clubs, Two of Clubs etc)
Cards are copied out of the deck and placed in a random order in a new shuffled deck.
Finally, the deck is printed.

What I learned:
Basic string manipulation
Nested for loops
Reorganising arrays
